# AlphaFold3 on Minerva (Singularity Workflow)

This repository contains the setup and workflow for running **AlphaFold3** on **Minerva** using Singularity (not Docker).

---

## Repository Contents (AF3_Materials)

The `AF3_Materials` directory contains the essential files and templates for running AlphaFold3 on Minerva:  

- **Singularity Container (`alphafold3.sif`)**  
  - Prebuilt container for running AlphaFold3.  
  - Minerva only supports **Singularity images** (not Docker).  
  - Converted from a Docker image (as of June 11, 2025).  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to its size (~14 GB), the container is **not stored in this repository**, but it is available in the `AF3_Materials` directory on Minerva.  
  - To use: copy to your working directory and **gunzip**.  

- **fold_input.json** *(example: `EXAMPLE_SLC6A14.json`)*  
  - Template JSON file containing basic input information for running AlphaFold3.  
  - Configured for **a single protein monomer with one ligand**.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be edited by the user to include:  
    - A name for the prediction.  
    - The amino acid sequence of the protein.  
    - The ligand SMILES string.  
  - For other complex types, see:  
    [AlphaFold3 Input Guide](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/docs/input.md#user-provided-ccd)  

- **input_run_af3_singularity.lsf**  
  - LSF batch submission script.  
  - Runs the Singularity container with user-provided input/output paths.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be edited by the user:  
    - Replace `"COMPLEX"` with your prediction name.  
    - Point to correct paths for input/output/parameters.  
    - Adjust resources for larger or multimeric complexes.  

- **Files in Singularity Folder.png**  
  - Screenshot showing all files in the **`standard_workflow`** directory.  
  - Provides a reference for how the workflow files should be organized when running jobs.  

- **README.md (this file)**  
  - Documentation of the workflow steps.  

- **AF3 Code**  
  - `run_alphafold.py`  
  - `src/` (supporting code for AlphaFold3 execution).

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Duplicate AF3 Materials
Copy the shared **AF3_Materials** directory to your own scratch folder:
```bash
cp -r /sc/arion/projects/schlea02a/AF3_Materials /sc/arion/scratch/$USER/
```
This ensures you have the necessary container, templates, and scripts in your personal space.

### 2. gunzip the Singularity Container (`alphafold3.sif`)

### 3. Upload AlphaFold3 Parameters
- Use sftp to upload AlphaFold3 parameters and you can refer to the instructions at the bottom of this readme file to understand AlphaFold3 parameters.
- **Recommended location:** `standard_workflow' and 'batch_workflow` inside your working directory.

### 4. Create a folder called "input" and move `fold_input.json` into "input" and Modify `fold_input.json`
- Define a **name** for your prediction.  
- Set the number of seeds:  
  - `numSeeds` = number of random seeds (default: 5 models √ó 1 seed). 
- Provide inputs:  
  - **Protein sequence** (amino acid FASTA format).  
  - **Ligand SMILES string**.  
- Copy/paste sequence and ligand SMILES into their respective fields.
- If you want to see one running successfully in the singularity case, simply upload the EXAMPLE_SLC6A14.json from the repository to the standard_workflow directory.

### 5. Create a directory called "out" to store output
- Create an **output directory** for results. In the sample in this directory, a directory called "out" was created, which you can see in the file Files in Singularity Folder.png.


### 6. Modify `input_run_af3_singularity.lsf`
- Replace the content with the `input_run_af3_singularity.lsf` file in this github repository directly and change the account name from wangy69 to your account name and change the input json file name to the input json file name you have set.
- Update paths for:  
  - Input JSON file.  
  - Output directory. (you can leave it the same as the directory in the lsf file in this directory since you have already created a directory called "out" earlier.
  - AlphaFold3 parameters.  
- Adjust resource requests for larger/multimeric complexes.
- If you want to see one running successfully in the singularity case, simply upload the input_run_af3_singularity.lsf from the repository to the standard_workflow directory.


### 5. Submit the Job
Run:
```bash
bsub < input_run_af3_singularity.lsf
```
### 6. Use sftp to get the output from Minerva to local and view the output
- You can view the output on https://pae-viewer.uni-goettingen.de/

## Runtime and Outputs

- Typical runtime:  
  - ~20‚Äì30 minutes for a monomer:ligand complex.  
  - 2 hours of resources requested by default.  

- Key output files:  
  - `*_model.cif` ‚Üí Most confident model.  
  - `*_summary_confidences.json` ‚Üí Confidence metrics for best model.  
  - Seed directories: contain all models and their individual `summary_confidences.json`.

---

## Notes
- Ensure all file paths are set correctly before submission.  
- Adjust resource requests in `.lsf` for larger/multimeric systems.  
- Store output results in scratch to avoid filling up project space.

# Uploading & Downloading Files to/from Minerva (via SFTP)

You can transfer files between your local machine and Minerva using **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

---

## Uploading (Local ‚Üí Minerva)

1. Open a terminal on your local computer.  
2. Navigate to the folder where your file is located:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my/local/files

3. Connect to Minerva via SFTP:

    ```bash
    sftp username@minerva.hpc.mssm.edu

Replace username with your Minerva account.

Enter your password (MSSM credentials + VIP Access code if required).

4. Navigate to your target folder on Minerva:

    ```bash
    cd /sc/arion/scratch/your_folder/

5. Upload a file:

    ```bash
    put myfile.json

6. Upload directories with:

    ```bash
    put -r mydir

7. Exit:

    ```bash
    exit

## Downloading (Minerva ‚Üí Local)

1. Connect via SFTP:

    ```bash
    sftp username@minerva.hpc.mssm.edu

2. Navigate to the remote folder:

    ```bash
    cd /sc/arion/scratch/your_folder/

3. Choose your local save directory:

    ```bash
    lcd /Users/you/Downloads

4. Download a file:

    ```bash
    get results_model.cif

5. Download directories with:

    ```bash
    get -r mydir

6. Exit:

    ```bash
    exit

Tips

    GUI options: You can also use FileZilla, Cyberduck, or WinSCP with the same host/credentials.

    Always confirm the correct directory before running put or get to avoid overwriting.
